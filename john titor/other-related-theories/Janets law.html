		<h1>Janets law</h1>
		<p> aging three years when you're 15 is like reliving 1/5 of your life, but aging the same three years when you're 45 is not even close (1/15 of your life).

for example,, on your 50th birthday, when you look at your age 49-50 year, you're accessing roughly 2% of your long-term memory

this theory was first put forth by Paul Janet in 1897</p>
