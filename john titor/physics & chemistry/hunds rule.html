		<h1>hunds rule</h1>
		<p>In atomic physics, Hund's rules refers to a set of rules that German physicist Friedrich Hund formulated around 1927, which are used to determine the term symbol that corresponds to the ground state of a multi-electron atom. The first rule is especially important in chemistry, where it is often referred to simply as Hund's Rule. The three rules are:[1][2][3] For a given electron configuration, the term with maximum multiplicity has the lowest energy. The multiplicity is equal to 2 S + 1 {\displaystyle 2S+1\ } 2S+1\ , where S {\displaystyle S} S is the total spin angular momentum for all electrons. Therefore, the term with lowest energy is also the term with maximum S {\displaystyle S\,} S \, . For a given multiplicity, the term with the largest value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L {\displaystyle L\,} L \, has the lowest energy. For a given term, in an atom with outermost subshell half-filled or less, the level with the lowest value of the total angular momentum quantum number J {\displaystyle J\,} J\, (for the operator J = L + S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {J}}={\boldsymbol {L}}+{\boldsymbol {S}}} {\boldsymbol {J}}={\boldsymbol {L}}+{\boldsymbol {S}}) lies lowest in energy. If the outermost shell is more than half-filled, the level with the highest value of J {\displaystyle J\,} J\, is lowest in energy.</p>
