		<h1>theory of relativity</h1>
		<p>The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.[1] Special Relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature.[2] It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.</p>
